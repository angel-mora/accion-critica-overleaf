# State and Economy from Tiqqun standpoint: Critical Action Perspectives

This book is my thesis work at UNAM MX to graduate from Philosophy. Started mostly as fragmentary writing. Little ideas intertwined that I used to create arguments. It is a tiny outline of ways how the State operates in this contemporary era, when desire flows over electric impulses and capitalism has gone far beyond its traditional ways to operate.

After graduating, decided to start playing around it now that I am also a programmer.
